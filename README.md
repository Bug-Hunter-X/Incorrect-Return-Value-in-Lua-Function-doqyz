# Lua Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a simple bug in a Lua function that results in an incorrect return value under certain conditions.  The function `myFunction` is intended to return the smaller of two numbers, but it fails to do so correctly when the first argument is greater than the second.

The bug is described in `bug.lua`. The corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.lua`.
